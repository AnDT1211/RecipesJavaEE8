### Problem: 
Your JSF application contains multiple pages, and you want to set up navigation between them.

### Solution:

co 3 cach
- use JSF controller class method along with a corresponding `faces-config.xml` configuration file to control the navigation for your application
- specifying the next view to render from within the controller class, returning the name of the view in String format from an action method.
- specifying the name of the view to render as the `action` attribute of a component tag, bypassing the controller class altogether.
